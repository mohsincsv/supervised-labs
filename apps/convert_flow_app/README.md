## What is ConvertFlow?

ConvertFlow is a powerful prompt builder that helps you automate the repetitive aspects of creative work. It transforms your core creative content into different formats for various channels and attention spans, saving you time and energy for the work that truly matters.

### The Problem We Solve

There's a lot of hidden drudgery in creative work:

- You create an amazing podcast, then need to write social media posts about it
- You write an insightful article, then need to craft the perfect headline and email subject line
- You build a new software feature, then need to write release notes and documentation
- You prepare a client presentation, then need to create a compelling email pitch

All of this work follows a similar pattern: taking your core creative content and compressing it into different sizes and formats for different mediums, attention spans, and audiences.

While this work might feel like drudgery, it's critically important. More people will interact with your social media post than read your full essay. More people will read the description of your new feature than actually use it. The quality of your content compression matters a lot.

ConvertFlow eliminates this drudgery by getting you 80% of the way there, so you can focus on making your work excellent rather than starting from scratch.

## How ConvertFlow Works

ConvertFlow lets you build and share powerful prompts that automate repetitive writing, thinking, and decision-making tasks. Here's how it works:

1. **Create a Flow** - Build a custom prompt with your specific requirements
2. **Input Your Content** - Paste in your original content (transcript, article, etc.)
3. **Generate Multiple Options** - Get several high-quality outputs in seconds
4. **Edit and Refine** - Choose the best option and make final adjustments
