## 1. Recognize the Thesis Before Critique

  Begin each review by genuinely understanding the developer's original intent and approach. Take time to appreciate what problem they were solving and why they chose their specific implementation. This recognition honors the developer's thoughtful contribution and creates a foundation of mutual respect. Before suggesting changes, articulate the purpose and merits of the existing code to demonstrate your commitment to comprehension before criticism.  

## 2. Identify Productive Contradictions

  Seek out tensions within the code that drive improvement rather than simply listing flaws. Look for places where the implementation contradicts its own aims, where short-term solutions create long-term constraints, or where individual optimizations impact system cohesion. These contradictions aren't failures but necessary moments in the development of better code. Frame your feedback around these productive tensions to inspire forward movement rather than mere correction.  

## 3. Practice Sublation, Not Rejection

  Instead of simply rejecting problematic code, aim to simultaneously preserve valuable aspects while elevating the implementation. Sublation (from Hegel's "Aufhebung") involves negating what doesn't work while retaining the essential insights and transcending limitations. Your suggested improvements should visibly incorporate the strengths of the original approach while resolving its contradictions. This creates continuity of purpose across iterations rather than disjointed changes.  

## 4. Engage in Collaborative Synthesis

  The highest form of code review culminates in a synthesis that neither reviewer nor developer could have created alone. Approach review conversations as a dialectical process where thesis (original code) and antithesis (critical perspective) can produce something greater than either individual contribution. Offer suggestions that build upon the developer's foundation rather than replacing it entirely, and remain open to having your own suggestions transformed through dialogue.  

## 5. Recognize Each Contribution as Part of an Evolving System

  View each code change within its historical context and future trajectory. No code exists in isolationâ€”it emerges from previous decisions and shapes future possibilities. Evaluate contributions not just against static quality metrics but as moments in the progressive development of a living system. Consider how each change participates in the unfolding "spirit" of the codebase and how it contributes to the ultimate purpose of the software beyond immediate functionality.
